1) OVERVIEW OF THE DATA FILE CONTENTS

The FLUXNET data products are generated from the AmeriFlux BASE data products by the AmeriFlux Management Project (AMP) using the ONEFlux processing codes (Learn about data pipeline at https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/data-processing-pipelines/). ONEFlux processing codes are jointly developed by a global collaboration that includes AMP. Key computation steps include friction velocity threshold estimation and filtering, gap-filling of micrometeorological and flux variables, partitioning of CO2 fluxes into ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, uncertainty estimates, and more (https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/data-processing/). The FLUXNET data product is compatible with the FLUXNET2015 dataset. Read a general overview of the processing codes in the following paper.

These example files are published by the AmeriFlux network (AMF), containing data collected at the "Harvard Forest EMS Tower (HFR1)" site (US-Ha1) from 1992 to 2020. 

GROUPING denotes grouping of variables from release included in a file, including:
* FULLSET: All flux, meteorological and soil variables, and associated quality and uncertainty information, and key variables from intermediate processing steps
* SUBSET: Core set of flux, meteorological and soil variables with quality and uncertainty information needed for general uses of the data. SUBSET data are a subset of FULLSET data.
* AUXMETEO: Auxiliary variables related to meteorological downscaling
* AUXNEE: Auxiliary variables related to Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Ecosystem respiration (RECO), and gross primary production (GPP) processing
* ERA5: Full record (1981–most recent year) of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) downscaled meteorological variables for the site location

RESOLUTION indicates the temporal resolution of the files, including half-hourly (HH), hourly (HR), daily (DD), weekly (WW), monthly (MM), and yearly (YY) time steps. Note that there are two possible finest-grained temporal resolutions for FLUXNET data products -- HR or HH -- depending on the temporal resolution of the original AmeriFlux BASE data product. 

SITE_VERSION is an integer indicating the version of the original dataset for the site used; CODE_VERSION indicates the version of the code of the data processing pipeline used to process the dataset for the site.

EXT: File extension, including csv: Comma-separated values in a text file (ASCII), and zip: Archive file with all temporal resolutions for the same site and data product.




3) DATA FILE CONTENTS

The complete output from the ONEFlux data processing pipeline includes over 200 variables: measured and derived data, quality flags, uncertainty quantification variables, and results from intermediate data processing steps. The variable names follow the naming conventions of <VARIABLE_ROOT>_<QUALIFIER>, where VARIABLE_ROOT describes the physical quantities (e.g., TA, NEE) and QUALIFIER describes the information of processing methods (e.g., VUT, CUT), uncertainties (e.g., RANDUNC), and quality flags (e.g., QC). See the VARIABLE LIST section below for details.

Timestamps in the data and metadata files use the format YYYYMMDDHHMM, truncated at the appropriate resolution (e.g., YYYYMMDD in daily or YYYYMM in monthly files). Two formats of time associated with a record are used: (1) single timestamp (i.e., TIMESTAMP in daily, monthly, yearly files), where the meaning of the timestamp is unambiguous, and (2) a pair of timestamps (i.e., TIMESTAMP_START, TIMESTAMP_END in (half-)hourly, weekly files), indicating the start and end of the period the timestamps represent. All timestamps are reported in local standard time (i.e., without daylight saving time). The time zone information with respect to UTC time is reported in the site metadata.

The number and order of columns in these files are not guaranteed to be uniform, except that timestamps are always located in the first or first-two column(s). The first row provides the variable labels (see VARIABLE LIST below).

These data files are provided as plain ASCII text using comma-separated values (CSV) formatting. The -9999 value indicates missing data records.

5) USAGE NOTE

Detailed documentation on how to use and interpret FLUXNET data product is available online at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/. A quick start guide (https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/variables-quick-start-guide/) also guides non-expert users to get started selecting variables quickly. Some main points about data usage are presented here.

Risks in the application of standard procedures:  When standardized methods are applied across different sites, the possible differences owing to data treatment are avoided or minimized. This is one of the main goals of FLUXNET data products and ONEFlux processing codes. However, there is also the possibility that the standard methods don’t work properly or as expected at specific sites and under certain conditions. This is particularly true for the CO2 flux partitioning, which as with all models, is based on assumptions that could not always be not valid. 

Using the QC flags: There are quality-control flag variables (i.e., _QC) in the dataset to help users filter and interpret variables, especially for gap-filled and process knowledge-based variables. For instance, TA_F_QC is the quality flag for the gap-filled air temperature variable TA_F. At the half-hourly or hourly resolution, the _QC variable indicates if the corresponding record is a measured value (_QC = 0​) or the quality level of the gap-filling that was used for that record (_QC = 1​ better, _QC = 3​ worse quality). At coarser temporal resolutions, i.e., daily (DD) through yearly (YY), the quality flag indicates the percentage of measured (_QC = 0​) or good quality gap-filled (_QC = 1​) records aggregated from finer temporal resolutions. 

Percentile variants for fluxes and reference values: For most flux variables, there are reference values and percentile versions of the variables to describe their uncertainty. For NEE, RECO, and GPP, the percentiles are generated from the bootstrapping of the USTAR threshold estimation step bootstrapping. Three different reference values are provided (i.e., _MEAN, _USTAR50, and _REF) to cover different user needs. The _REF version should be the most representative, particularly if related to the percentiles. For the energy-balance-corrected H and LE variables, the percentiles (e.g., _CORR, _CORR_25, _CORR_75) indicate the variability due to the uncertainty in the correction factor applied.
